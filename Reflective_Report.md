### Problem Solving and Learning with Jupyter Notebooks?
Jupyter notebooks facilitates good workflow for coding as it lays out different code cells that can be run to show different outputs. This has allowed me to compare the outputs of different code in an organised and convenient fashion, which allows me to solve problems regarding correctness of code or problems that are specific to a certain project. For example, if I have a lengthy list of commands that when run all together do not produce the targeted output or an error, I can break down the code into different cells to compare and analyse the output of each specific command to find what I need to fix. Notebooks also allows me to run code chronologically rather than all at once which helps people reading the notebook understand each step and its purpose. Also, the markdown cells help provide structure and detail to notebooks which help increase organisation while coding and also presentation. Overall Jupyter notebooks, for the reasons stated above, have helped me solve problems throughout the unit and in the portfolio projects. Throughout the unit I have learnt how to use code cells to chronologically run sets of code, breakdown long chunks of code and detail and organise my projects with markdown. For the future I am excited to create more advanced machine learning models on larger and more insightful datasets using Jupyter notebooks. 

### Why I chose the dataset that I used in portfolio project 4?
The main reason why I chose the dataset I did for the project was because I was looking for comprehensive and detailed data that would help me make some insightful analysis of the sport of MMA, a sport which I am extremely interested and knowledgeable in. This data set had lots of interesting features and it covered all the possible in fight statistics possible and also it had all the UFC fights. Henceforth it was exactly the kind of data I was looking for. This dataset is also from Kaggle however it had missing values and features which required editing inorder to be used in machine learning models. This would help me display my data preparation knowledge for the assignment which was another motivating factor in selecting the dataset.

### What insights I gained from portfolio project 4 and whether or not they were consistent with my expectations?
One conclusion I came to from my study was that the frequency of different techniques used in an MMA bout are very good at predicting the outcome of that bout. This was consistent with my pre-existing beliefs about MMA.
The other conclusion that I came to was that grappling is extremely important in MMA while variety in strikes is not. I had expected features counting the statistics related to the grappling aspect of a bout to be fairly good predictors however I wasnâ€™t expecting the features which counted leg and body strikes to be much less significant.
